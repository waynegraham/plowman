          <p>William Langlandâ€™s 14th-century poem The Vision of Piers Plowman
          was one of the most popular works of the Middle Ages, inspiring many
          of its copyists and readers to leave their own notes in their copies
          of the poem.  This website presents the marginal annotations from 15
          manuscripts and early print editions, together with the text of the
          poem so that they can be compared and studied in context.</p>
